## UTM-Builder

Meetanshiâ€™s ***[UTM builder](https://meetanshi.com/utm-builder)*** is a tool that allows you to create unique tracking codes for your website URLs. These codes, also known as UTM parameters, allow you to track the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns by providing data on where your website traffic is coming from.

Using a UTM builder is simple. You enter the URL of the page you want to track, and then add the UTM parameters that you want to include. These can include the campaign name, source, medium, and content. Once you have filled in these fields, the UTM builder will generate a unique tracking code that you can add to the end of your URL.

When someone clicks on a link with a UTM code, the data from the code is sent to Google Analytics, allowing you to track the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns. You can see how many people clicked on the link, where they came from, and what actions they took on your website. This information can be used to optimize your campaigns and improve your ROI.

Using a UTM builder is a great way to gain insight into the performance of your marketing campaigns. By tracking your website traffic, you can see which campaigns are working and which are not, and make adjustments accordingly. It can help you to identify the best sources of traffic, and the most effective types of content, and make better-informed decisions about where to allocate your marketing budget. Overall, UTM builder is a powerful and essential tool for any digital marketer who wants to track the performance of their campaigns and make data-driven decisions.
